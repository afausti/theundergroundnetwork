    <h3>Fall 2021</h3>

    <p>During this season as soon as our plants started to grow, we noticed Gopher activity starting early November mainly at the Jojobas and Jaguars neighborhoods, on plots 16, 20, 21, 29 and 45.</p>

    <p>We are testing a sonic repeller that vibrates at 400Hz for 3 seconds every 20 seconds. Two sonic repllers were installed at the Jojobas neighborhood on November 23 inside plots 21 and 24.</p>
